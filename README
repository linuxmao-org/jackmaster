jackmaster - A "Master Console" for the jack-audio-connection-kit

Features:
---------
* 100% pure C
* Low CPU usage
* Session management via LASH
* Fader automation via ALSA sequencer
* Number of inputs: unlimited (actually, it depends on things like available
  memory, the architecture and compiler. Lets just say: enaugh)
* Crosstalk: 0.0 dB
* Dynamics range: somewhere in the vicinity of 1529.23 dB


Bugs:
-----
huh?


Minor shortcomings:
-------------------
* When an active channel is rerouted, you might hear a click (although i
  never noticed such a thing, i know it *must* be there occasionally)
* Ugly icon (at least, it is recognisable)
* Number of inputs/subs and screen layout can only be changed by recompiling
* Only stereo ports
* No aux-sends/returns yet
* No (LADSPA-)insert effects (yet)


Optimisation:
-------------
For low CPU usage, the whole thing should be compiled for your CPU,
using the STD_OPT_CFLAGS variable in configure (or configure.in).
Furthermore, the audio engine should be compiled for utmost speed,
using the MAX_OPT_CFLAGS variable in configure (or configure.in).
If you have a different CPU than athlon-xp, you have to adjust the
mentioned variables.

Here are the results of some tests i ran (with gcc 3.4.4):
option:			result (compared to -O3 only):
-ffast-math		roughly 20% faster
-ftracer		up to 6.5% faster
-fsched-spec-load	a tiny bit faster, except for bufsize=16 and 32 where it was a tiny bit slower
-funit-at-a-time	a tiny bit slower
-mfpmath=sse		up to 35% SLOWER
-fprefetch-loop-arrays	about 10% slower, except for bufsize=4096 where it was 15% faster
-mmmx -m3dnow -msse 	a tiny bit slower, except for bufsize=1024 where it was a bit faster

Also, it turned out that you better avoid bufsize=4096, 'cause it was (surprisingly) much slower
than 2048 (and below). Also, below 128 the performance (not so surprising) dropped sharply.
The best results were achived with bufsize=1024.


Installation:
-------------
Just the usual
./configure
make
make install (as root, if you can't write in /usr/local)
